<h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>The animation on this movie is godly along with the story telling.</p>

<h3>The Bee Movie</h3>
<p>I've seen this movie probably about 100 times and it never gets old. (And no, I'm not joking)</p>

<h3>John Wick 4</h3>
<p>The stunts are great, along with the countless fight scenes. I also really like the story, although that's not what most people watch John Wick for.</p>

<hr>
<p>I would also like to add that <strong><em>many more</em></strong> movies could've gone in this list.</p>
